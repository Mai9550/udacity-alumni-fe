# Udacity Alumni Client App

## Getting Started

The project started as a fork of the [Scalable React Boilerplate](https://github.com/RyanCCollins/scalable-react-boilerplate) project.  Please reference the repository for details on the features and conventions of the boilerplate.

We have switched to using Yarn as the official package manager for this project.  Please install it globally with `npm install -g yarn`.  I hope after this that you never again run into npm issues :tada:.

### Installing
The package.json file includes over a dozen npm scripts to make most tasks a breeze.

Installation can be achieved by running
```
npm run setup
```

To get the development server running, please run
```
npm run start
```

and navigate to http://0.0.0.0:1337

To run the test suite, please run `npm run test`, which will pick up any file with the word 'test' in its name.

Again, please reference the [Scalable React Boilerplate](https://github.com/RyanCCollins/scalable-react-boilerplate) project for details regarding the scripts.

## Grommet Udacity
We are using an amazing React component library that will accelerate our development in this and any future projects.  The [Grommet](http://grommet.io) library has been forked and published to the grommet-udacity npm package.  We will be using this package in our projects and also will be adding stylesheets and components so that we have a maintainable component library for all future projects.  Please refer to the [Grommet Udacity](https://github.com/udacityalumni/alumni-client/wiki/Grommet-Udacity) wiki for more information.

## Deployment
The project will be deployed via Docker to an ExpressJS server.  Configuration will be included with the starter project.
